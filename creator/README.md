# Creator

The creator is a single page Angular app for creating the slideshows. It should be fairly easy to use,
but it's very much a preview still and doesn't do many of the things you would expect it to. For instance,
you can drag and drop new content onto the canvas, but you can't drag and drop content already on the canvas.
It also **does not** warn you if you're going to close the tab and lose your work. Expect improvements to this over
time, and for now you can try it out [here](https://mathiasronimus.github.io/Fluid-Math/creator-site/).
